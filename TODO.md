# ToDos for ASSRUnit

## designer
change main ui interface in qt (pyside) designer

+ include task params choice before visuilization
+ save params should be possible

## project structure
change overall structure of project to have more modularity and better overview for development

+ move constants, capabilities, visualizations.py in assrunit, ...
+ main folder should only contain py files, no npy etc.
+ rm Seeds.npy from main folder
+ assrunit/acnet: create paramsclass.py? , put the rest into data folder

## documentation
include autogenerated documentations

+ check for libs, e.g. sphinx
+ adapt and use uniform format
+ do autogenerated UMLs make sense, probaly not in python?
+ type the project function variables and returns for better doc?

## create simple automated deployment method of the whole project (maybe configurable if needed)

+ create a binary for program (maybe folder or single main.py)
+ makefile which does all necessary installations/uninstalls and creates all the rcs, bin files and main executable script (bsh + win) for execution of the app
+ add to run app: main.py: 
  if __name__ == '__main__':

    import sys
    from package import app
    sys.exit(app.run())
+ ??maybe no full global install on each OS  is needed?? windows, mac, linux - might be enough to manually execute the main, depends on the potential users
+ automated tests

## configuration
add all possilbe configurations

+ use of config tool (Hydra?)
+ adjustable parameter configs for models and tasks
+ configs should be savable
